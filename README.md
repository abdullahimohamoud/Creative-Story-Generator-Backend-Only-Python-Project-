# Creative-Story-Generator-Backend-Only-Python-Project-
A Python-only backend project that generates unique short stories by randomly combining characters, settings, conflicts, and twists from local files. It uses the random module and saves outputs as text. Optional voice narration and user input make it a fun, creative storytelling tool.
